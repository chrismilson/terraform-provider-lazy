# lazy_string (Resource)

This is a logical resource (like `null_resource`) that will maintain its previous value unless an explicit update value is specified.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    lazy = {
      source = "chrismilson/lazy"
    }
  }
}

variable "enable_public_ingress" {
  type    = bool
  default = null
}

resource "lazy_string" "enable_public_ingress" {
  initially  = false
  explicitly = var.enable_public_ingress
}

output "public_ingress_status" {
  value = lazy_string.enable_public_ingress.result ? "enabled" : "disabled"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `explicitly` (String) When set, this will determine the value of `result`. If unset, it will be maintained at its previous value to avoid changes in the plan.
- `initially` (String) This will determine the value of the `result` on create if no value is supplied explicitly. In general this should be a static value to avoid unnecessary terraform changes.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) This is set to a random value at create time.
- `last_updated` (String) This is updated to the current time whenever `result` is changing.
- `result` (String) This is the canonical value for the resource. Depends on whether a value is (or has been in the past) supplied explicitly, or initially.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import lazy_string.enable_public_ingress "true"
```
